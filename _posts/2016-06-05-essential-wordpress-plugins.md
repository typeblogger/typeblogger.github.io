If you ask me what my favourite content management system is, it has got to be [WordPress](http://wordpress.org). I use it on almost all of my [client's sites](/portfolio) due to its intuitive, simple yet powerful user interface, not to mention because of the fact that it has over 40,000+ free plugins available for download.

For today's post, I'll be going through 9 essential WordPress plugins you _absolutely_ need for your website, from tools to help engage your audience to ultimate protection against hackers. Ready? Let's go!

## [Jetpack by WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/)

I love this plugin so much that I couldn't resist not adding it into this list. Jetpack is a free plugin from [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com) that puts a whole set of powerful tools at your fingertips, such as traffic growth and insights, protection against brute force attacks, image optimisation, a centralised dashboard located at [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com) and much, much more.

You can download Jetpack [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/), right from the WordPress.org website.

## [WP Smush by WPMU DEV](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/)

By now, you probably already know the [importance of site speed](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/speed-is-a-killer/) and how optimising your images can give your website the speed boost it needs.

Well, this plugin aims to solve all your image optimisation needs by automatically compressing every image that you upload to the server in order to reduce its file size. Simple, yet useful.

## [WooCommerce by WooThemes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/)

Need to sell products on your WordPress website, but don't want to use some third-party software? WooCommerce allows you to seamlessly integrate a fully-featured online store with your website, for free.

With powerful features such as shipping options, extensive payment options and complete control of your store, from taxes to stock levels to customer accounts, you can see why WooCommerce is the #1 choice when it comes to online stores.

## [Share Buttons by AddThis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/addthis/)

Need to add share buttons to your website without any hassle? I've found AddThis' sharing tools to be the most easy and reliable - the only thing you need to do is install the plugin on your website in order to gain access to AddThis' powerful sharing tools.

You can download AddThis' sharing tools [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/addthis), right from the WordPress.org website.

## [WP Super Cache by Automattic](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/)

Caching can be really useful for speeding up your website, as well as take off some of the load from your server. WP Super Cache is a simple yet intuitive caching plugin that does just that. 

The plugin generates static HTML files and serves that file to your visitors instead of processing the comparatively heavier WordPress PHP scripts.

Besides caching, it also does a number of other speed optimisations, such as minifying your HTML and CSS files and PHP caching.

You can download WP Super Cache [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo), right from the WordPress.org website.

## [Yoast SEO by Yoast](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/)

Yoast SEO is a set of powerful tools that aims to help you to improve your website's SEO on all needed aspects. Some of the features Yoast SEO has to offer include:

* Automatic page analysis
* Search engine optimisation
* XML sitemaps
* RSS optimisation

And much, much more!

## [Askimet by Automattic](https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/)

As I covered in [this blog post](http://brunotandev.github.io/2016/05/30/stop-comment-spam/), comment spam is not only very annoying, but can also harm your blog in many ways. 

Fortunately, Askimet allows you to catch those annoying spammers by checking your comments against the Akismet Web service to see if they look like spam or not, and lets you review the spam it catches under the "Comments" section in your WordPress dashboard.

You can download Askimet [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/), right from the WordPress.org website.

## [Contact Form 7 by Takayuki Miyoshi](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/)

Need a free and easy way for your visitors to contact you? Contact Form 7 allows you to embed a simple contact form on any page using shortcodes.

Contact Form 7 can manage multiple contact forms at the same time, plus you can fully customise the form and the mail contents. The form supports Ajax-powered submitting, CAPTCHA, Akismet spam filtering and lots more!

You can download Contact Form 7 [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7), right from the WordPress.org website.

## [Wordfence Security by Wordfence](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/)

Although powerful and flexible, WordPress suffers from many hidden security vulnerabilities. 

Wordfence is my go-to plugin for enhancing the security of any WordPress website. Wordfence promises to be the most complete security solution ever created for WordPress, and I can see why - the sheer number of features this plugin boasts is impressive. Here are just some of them:

* WordPress firewall to block common security threats like fake Googlebots, malicious scans from hackers and botnets.
* Scans core files, themes and plugins against WordPress.org repository versions to check their integrity. 
* Login security to lock out brute force hacks and to stop WordPress from revealing info that will compromise security.
* Monitor your DNS for unauthorized DNS changes.
* A real-time view of all traffic including automated bots that often constitute security threats that Javascript analytics packages never show you.
