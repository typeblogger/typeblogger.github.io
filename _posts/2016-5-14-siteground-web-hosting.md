You've decided that you want to have your own website, yet the moment you take a look at the long list of web hosting companies, you start to feel intimidated. _Which should I choose?_ you ask.

That's why I'm introducing you to SiteGround - the web hosting company that I personally use for my client sites and highly recommend. I love SiteGround because it is so easy to get a website up and running with them - anyone could just visit SiteGround, pick a shared hosting plan (more about that later), and voilà! You now have a brand new website. So what are you waiting for? Let's get cracking!

The first thing you will want to do is to visit the SiteGround website. Just click on <a href="https://www.siteground.com/go/bruno" target="_blank">this link</a> - it'll automatically open up the signup page in a new tab. Got there already? Great! Now, on that page, you should see 3 different shared hosting plans (shared hosting means that your website is hosted together with other people's websites on the same server) namely StartUp, GrowBig and GoGeek. If you're just setting up a small website then StartUp should be more than enough, but if you're setting up an eCommerce website for your business or plan on running multiple websites on the same account then I suggest you should go for GrowBig or GoGeek. You can get more important details about each plan on the SiteGround website.

<h2>Choosing Your Domain</h2>

Have you chosen which hosting plan you want? If so, great! You've finally come to the fun part - choosing your domain name. SiteGround gives a free domain name to everyone who uses their hosting, so you won't have to pay a single cent. So go ahead, get your creative juices flowing and think of an excellent domain name for your new website.

<h2>Setting Up Your Website</h2>

Once you've made your purchase, head over to your cPanel and from there, you should be able to setup the necessary files required for your website, or even install a shiny new content management system!

Congratulations, you've finally finished setting up your website! Enjoy your brand new website hosted by SiteGround's blazing fast servers! :)
