If you're just starting out in the world of blogging, one of the earliest decisions you'll have to make is choosing the blogging platform that powers your blog.

Don't worry - choosing the right blogging platform doesn't have to be difficult. In this post, I’ll be going through 3 of the most popular blogging platforms, as well as their advantages and disadvantages below. I’ll also be going through who each platform is for in order to help you choose the best platform for your own blogging needs.

But first, let’s take a look at what a blogging platform is and what it does below.

## What is a blogging platform?

A blogging platform is the software or service that you use to publish your content onto the internet in the form of a blog. Blogging platforms usually come in the form of software you install on your own server, or a hosted solution managed by a team of developers.

Now that you understand what a blogging platform is, let's take a look at 3 of the most popular blogging platforms below, as well as discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

## 1. [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com) and [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org)

**Type**: Free

One in every six websites run on WordPress, the most popular blogging platform in the world. WordPress is both a hosted blogging service (via WordPress.com), and a content management system for self-hosted blogs (via WordPress.org). With a huge library of plugins and themes, WordPress is the number choice for bloggers who want a powerful and highly customisable content management system to kickstart their blog growth.

You may not know this, but even some of the most popular blogs in the world run on WordPress, including TechCrunch, Quartz, Fortune and Time Inc.

### Advantages

- A WordPress blog is extremely versatile - it can be made to run everything, from an eCommerce store to a tumblog.
- If you're rocking the self-hosted version (which is also open source), the only expenses are server and domain costs, whereas the hosted blogging service is completely free.
- WordPress has hundreds of thousands of plugins and themes created by its vibrant open-source community. Heck, if you know a bit of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP you can even start creating your own plugins and themes!

### Disadvantages

- WordPress can be difficult to use for the less tech-savvy, although there are many excellent tutorials on the Internet that will help you to get things done in no time.
- To take full advantage of WordPress features, you’ll need to host it on your own server, which can be pretty expensive when you take into consideration the server hosting, domain and CDN costs associated with running your own server.
- Customization often requires tinkering with code, which I understand can sometimes be difficult and frustrating for non-coders. 


### Recommended For

Professional bloggers.
- Media companies and businesses that need the speed and flexibility of WordPress.

## 2. [Blogger](http://blogger.com)

**Type**: Free

Also known as BlogSpot, Blogger is a Google owned blogging platform. Blogger was one of the earliest blogging services available and still remains popular among casual bloggers.

Popular blogs on the Blogger platform include the Twitter blog, PostSecret, and most of Google’s own blogs.

### Advantages

- Blogger’s simple and intuitively designed dashboard is perfect for beginners who are just starting out and don't need access to advanced options.
- Blog from anywhere, any time - Blogger users can publish to their blogs via desktop, mobile or tablets via dedicated apps.
- Monetisation has never been easier thanks to direct integration with Google AdSense, which is great news for those who want to make money with their blogs.
- Completely free - you don't even need to pay a single cent for hosting!

### Disadvantages

- No access to the backend code.
- Very limited themes and design styles, especially when compared to WordPress.
- Little community support in the form of plugins.

### Recommended For
- Casual bloggers.
- Beginners who are just starting out.

## 3. [Typepad](http://typepad.com)

**Type**: Paid, starting at $8.95 per month.

![Typepad Logo](https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7005/27497683076_91402c3974_c.jpg)

Typepad is one of the oldest premium blogging platforms in existence and continues to be one of the most popular blogging platforms ever, hosting the blogs of Paris Hilton and Seth Godin.

### Advantages

- Just like Blogger, Typepad users can publish via desktop, mobile or tablets via dedicated apps.
- No more fiddling with complicated JavaScript code, Typepad has built-in analytics tools that give you comprehensive insights of your website's audience.
- Typepad promotes blogs on its own network, leading to more traffic on your blog. Woohoo!
- Amazing customer support - if you need help setting up your blog, the Typepad team has got your back.

### Disadvantages

- Expensive when compared to free alternatives like WordPress.com and Blogger.
- Lacks the features and flexibility of WordPress, such as plugins.
- Existing themes look a little dated.

### Recommended For

- Professional bloggers.
- Bloggers who need something more stable and secure.

## Verdict

Professional bloggers and media companies will love the speed and flexibility WordPress offers, while new bloggers might prefer Blogger’s simple and easy-to-use platform that's also completely free at the same time. If you need something that’s stable and secure, but don't need the flexibility of WordPress or need something more robust than what Blogger has to offer, then Typepad might be the perfect choice for you.
