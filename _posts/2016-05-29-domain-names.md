Thinking about purchasing a domain name for your website? Sometimes, choosing the right domain name can be hard. Maybe it’s because the domain name you want has already been taken by someone else. Or maybe it’s because you need something a little more unique.

This guide aims to help all you folks out there find a great domain name that’ll go a long way in establishing a successful online presence.

## Tip #1: Do some research
Doing a bit of research before making the decision to purchase your domain name really helps, in most cases. During your free time, take a look at other blogs similar to yours. What keywords or terms do they use in their domain name? Try brainstorming some potential domain names and check whether they’re available using a domain name checker like [GoDaddy.com](http://godaddy.com).

## Tip #2: Keep it short and simple
A great domain name is always short, simple and to the point. Try to describe the purpose of your blog in as little words as possible and put it in your domain name. For example, Blogging Ninja is a website about blogging tips and tutorials, so we named our blog Blogging Ninja.

## Tip #3: Try to avoid numbers
If possible, avoid having numbers in your domain name. People can get confused about whether the numbers is a digit (3) or a word (three). If you really need to put a number in your domain name, the best thing to do is to buy both versions (digit and word) and redirect one to the other.

## Tip #4: Avoid hyphens as well
Similarly, putting hyphens in your domain name can get people confused about whether there are hyphens or not. Again, the best thing to do is to buy both versions (hyphenated and unhyphenated) and redirect one to the other.

## Tip #5: Think about what domain name extension you'll be using
Most of the time a .com or .net works pretty well, but if you want something more unique, there are thousands of other options for you to choose, such as .ninja or .pro.

## Tip #6: Check for availability on social media sites
When you have a name picked out, go check if that word or phrase is available on social media sites like [Facebook](https://facebook.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com), [YouTube](https://youtube.com), [Instagram](https://instagram.com) and [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com). Even if you don’t plan on using social media right away, you’ll want to have the option when you’re ready, and it’s easiest if you can use the same phrase on each site.

So that's it for today's post! Thank you for reading, and we hope you manage to find the perfect domain name for your website.
